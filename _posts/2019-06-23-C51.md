C51 is one of favriote RL algorithm, because of its unique approach of calculating the distribution of returns rather then calculating the expectation of rewards. I firsly heard of this approach in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsuvM1jO-4w">this(AI Prism: Deep RL bootcamp)</a> youtube vedio. Someone with basic knowlwdge of DQN and policy gradient algoritms should definetly watch the complete course. C51 has some modified versions too like [QR-DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10044.pdf) and [IQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06923), C51 can be easily visulalised compared to QR-DQN and IQN so before going into them we must know about C51 and the distributional perspertive of RL. I have implemented C51 and QR-DQN and this blog will help readers to understand Disrtributional RL. I have also written some of my observation. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/adityauser/Quest-RL/tree/master/Distributional-RL).<br>

# Distributional RL 
<br> 
The idea behind learning distribution of future returns insted of just learning the expected value is to make model capable of learnig intrensic randomness(Stochastic dynamics, Stochastic reward) of the returns. Consider a person bought a lottry and so other 1000 person. Lucky 10 person will get 1M dollar if the person wins, which is 1 in a 100 chance he will get 1M dollars otherwise he will get 0 dollars with chance 90 in 100 so, expeted amount your friend will get is 1000 dollars and traditional Value based Deep RL algorithm learn to calculate the expected reward but in reality he will never get reward of 1000 dollars i.e. we are getting false knowlwdeg of the possoble returns, Returns can be multimidal like in the lottry senario due to which varience is too high which makes the convergennce difficult.

## Distributional Bellman Equation <br>
Very similar to the [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) $$Distributional Bellman Equation$$ is expressed as
**$$Z(s,a) = r + \gamma Z(s^\prime,a^\prime)$$**
Where, $$Z$$ represents the distribution of future rewards, unlike Q which is a scalar. According to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887) *the $$distributional Bellman equation$$ states that the distribution of $$Z$$ is characterized by the interaction of three random variables: the reward $$R$$, the next state-action$$(X′,A′)$$, and its random return $$Z(X′,A′)$$. By analogy with the well-known case, we call this quantity the $$value distribution$$.*

### Value distribution 
![](https://github.com/adityauser/blog/blob/master/assets/img/Aoms.png) 
The output of C51 algorithm is Discrete Probability Distribution of returns as shown above, discrete distribution can easily take form of multimodal distribution. The vertical axis represents the probability. The horizontal bars are called atoms, they are the “canonical returns” of the distribution. Atoms are placed at regular intervals on the $$return axis$$, which ranges from minimum possoble return to maximum possible return.
<br>
### Distributional Bellman equation dynamics

Next state distribution under policy $$\pi$$: $Z(s^\prime,a^\prime)$$ where $$s^\prime$$ and $$a^\prime$$ are next state obtained after trainsition from state $$s$$ taking action $$a$$ and $$a^\prime$$ is action taken at state $$s^\prime$$.

![Next state distribution under policy $$\pi$$](https://github.com/adityauser/blog/blob/master/assets/img/Transition.png) 

Multiply each support(distribution) by the discount factor $$\gamma$$, since $$\gamma$$ is less than 1 it shrink the whole distribution towards 0.

![Discounting shrinks the distribution towards 0](https://github.com/adityauser/blog/blob/master/assets/img/Shrink.png) 

Adding reward $$r$$ to each support(distribution), which cause shift in the distribution.
![Add reward and shift](https://github.com/adityauser/blog/blob/master/assets/img/Shift.png) 

All the above operation has changed the atoms so we need to change the support of the target distribution with the original support i.e. projrction.

## Loss Function
<br>
The paper uses use [Cross Entropy](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html)(Kullback–Leibler divergence) loss function:
$$-\sum_{i=1}^Ny_{i}\log(p_{i})$$

$$N$$ - Number of atoms
$$log$$ - the natural log
$$y_{i}$$ - target for $$i$$th atom
$$p_{i}$$ - predicted for $$i$$th atom

### Earth mover distance

The paper talk a lot about Wasserstein distance, but in practice they used a KL-based procedure.
I tried of my own to get some result using EDM(Earth movers distance/1st Wasserstein distance) as the loss function, but it is not stable.
I tried different learning-rate and optimizers(SGD, Adam, rmsprop). I got the best result with rmsprop(lr=0.001). You can look for it in my GitHub reposotary [Quest-RL](https://github.com/adityauser/Quest-RL).
In the next iteration of the C51 algorithm i.e. Quantile Regression-DQN the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10044.pdf) also talks about how we can use Wasserstein distance in practice. I have implemented QR-DQN you can find it [here](https://github.com/adityauser/Quest-RL) very soon I will write a blog for the same.
